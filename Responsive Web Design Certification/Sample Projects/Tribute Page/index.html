        <p>Spade, (December 24, 1962 â€“ June 5, 2018) was born Katherine Noel Brosnahan in Kansas City, Missouri. She is the daughter of June (Mullen) and Francis (Frank) Brosnahan, who owned a road-construction company. She was of mostly Irish descent. After graduating from St. Teresa's Academy, an all-female Catholic high school, Spade attended the University of Kansas. She later transferred to Arizona State University. She joined the Kappa Kappa Gamma sorority and graduated with a journalism degree in 1985, thinking she would go into television production. While in college, she worked in sales at Carter's Men Shop, a men's clothing store in Phoenix; her co-worker was Andy Spade, who later became her husband and business partner.</p>

        <p>It all started back in 1993, when Kate Brosnahan Spade, a former accessories editor at Mademoiselle, set out to design the perfect handbag. Debuting with just six silhouettes, she combined sleek, utilitarian shapes and colorful palettes in an entirely new way..And so Kate Spade New York was born. Women and fashion editors fell for the fresh, modern sensibility, and our first shop in new york city swiftly opened in 1996. as the company grew, our graphic approach and trademark wit created a visual shorthand for a brand recognizable the world over.
